## Acknowledgements

Project code originally was based on Chris Hammond's [HammerFlex](https://github.com/ChrisHammond/HammerFlex) skin
and utilizes some ideas of [Tidy](http://tidy.codeplex.com/) skin. If you are looking for a ready-to-deploy skin for DNN Plaftorm
you should really try them first!
