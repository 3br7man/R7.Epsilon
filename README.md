# About R7.Epsilon

R7.Epsilon is a project dedicated to develop opensource responsive skin for DNN Platform using Bootstrap 3. 
It is on early stages of development, so not expect anything beautiful nor useful - it's a total experiment 
(ETA about first half year of 2015). 

Project code based on Chris Hammond's [HammerFlex](https://github.com/ChrisHammond/HammerFlex) skin and utilizes 
some ideas of [Tidy](http://tidy.codeplex.com/) skin. If you are looking for a ready-to-deploy skin for DNN Plaftorm
you should really try them first!
